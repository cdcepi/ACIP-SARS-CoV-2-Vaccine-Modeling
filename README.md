# ACIP SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine-Modeling

The [**Nursing Home Model**](https://github.com/cdcepi/ACIP-SARS-CoV-2-Vaccine-Modeling/tree/master/Nursing%20Home%20Model) folder contains materials which can be used to replicate the SNF model from the [*Modeling Allocation Strategies for the Initial SARS-CoV-2
Vaccine Supply*](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-08/COVID-06-Slayton.pdf) presentation at the 8/26/2020 public ACIP meeting.

The R markdown file [*ACIP_Vaccine_Modeling_Analysis.Rmd*](https://github.com/cdcepi/ACIP-SARS-CoV-2-Vaccine-Modeling/blob/master/ACIP_Vaccine_Modeling_Analysis.Rmd) can be used to replicate the [*Modeling Strategies for the Initial Allocation of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines*](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-10/COVID-Biggerstaff.pdf) presentation from the 10/30/2020 ACIP meeting, as well as the [brief update](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdf) shared at the 11/23/2020 ACIP meeting (see slides 18-22).
